Title: Flu Vaccinating Analysis
Dataset: https://data.cdc.gov/Flu-Vaccinations/Vaccines-gov-Flu-vaccinating-provider-locations/bugr-bbfr

Vaccination is especially important for individuals to protect public health and reducing the spread of the flu. In this project, we utilize the Vaccines.gov dataset to locate providers offering flu vaccines in a particular area, as well as to visualize interesting patterns based on geospatial analysis and generate a Decision Support system and a Stock Management system. Our goal is to make it easier for individuals to find healthcare providers offering flu vaccines, and to help public health officials and healthcare providers identify areas where there may be gaps in vaccination coverage which can ultimately help to prevent the spread of the flu.
