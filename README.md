# R-ShinyApp
This is the final project of A Team for class IE6600. The purpose of the project is to apply the knowledge learned in the class to real-world problems. Projects will help students gain working experience in data visualization, data processing, data exploration, and development of a web app, here we use R and RShiny to approach such goals.

Dataset: https://data.cdc.gov/Flu-Vaccinations/Vaccines-gov-Flu-vaccinating-provider-locations/bugr-bbfr

## Project Overview
Vaccination is especially important for individuals to protect public health and reducing the spread of the flu. In this project, we utilize the Vaccines.gov dataset to locate providers offering flu vaccines in a particular area, as well as to visualize interesting patterns based on geospatial analysis and generate a Decision Support system and a Stock Management system. Our goal is to make it easier for individuals to find healthcare providers offering flu vaccines, and to help public health officials and healthcare providers identify areas where there may be gaps in vaccination coverage which can ultimately help to prevent the spread of the flu.
